                    <div class="main">
                        <p>I grew up in Beachwood, Ohio (a suburb of Cleveland). Currently, I am a second year Computer Science and Engineering student
                        at
                        The Ohio State University. My program includes a
                        specialization in
                        software engineering.
                        I am eager to continue learning and creating <a
                            href="https://andrewlubinger.dev/legacy/3/projects.html">projects</a>.
                        I am looking to gain valuable
                        experience through a summer internship program. I am
                        passionate
                        about software development and technology as a whole.

                        <br><br>I have been interested in technological advancements
                        for as long as I can remember, but my interests really
                        expanded when
                        I took AP Computer Science in my sophomore year of high
                        school. This class very quickly became my favorite and it
                        was my first
                        experience in programming. After such a positive experience,
                        I went on to take a couple more programming classes: Honors
                        Software Engineering
                        and Honors Robotics. I also became a member of the Robotics
                        team with a role in programming our robot. I joined our
                        Science Olympiad team with an event leader
                        role in my favorite event: Game On, in which a pair had to
                        create a game using Scratch (a new type of programming to
                        me). I also joined our Science
                        and Engineering Fair Club. Through this club, I created an
                        <a
                            href="https://andrewlubinger.dev/legacy/3/projects/energyswitch.html">iPhone
                            App</a> and a <a href="https://andrewlubinger.dev/legacy/3/projects/writinganalytics.html">Java program</a>
                        on my own and won awards. More recently, I have completed
                        coursework and projects at The Ohio State University. I have
                        also created another
                        <a
                            href="https://andrewlubinger.dev/legacy/3/projects/personalapp.html">iPhone
                            App</a> in my own personal time. I also created an <a
                            href="https://andrewlubinger.dev/legacy/3/projects/studentorgtinder.html">iPhone
                            App</a> at the 2018 Hack Ohi/o hackathon in a team of three. All of these 
                            <a href="https://andrewlubinger.dev/legacy/3/projects.html">projects</a>
                        have
                        impacted my knowledge, interests, and experience. My passion
                        for software development has grown constantly since taking
                        AP Computer Science and
                        it is still continuing to grow with every project I
                        complete.

                        <br><br>I am extremely excited to continue learning at The
                        Ohio State University, complete personal <a href="https://andrewlubinger.dev/legacy/3/projects.html">projects</a>, and gain
                        experience through an
                        internship. I am motivated to earn one of these available
                        opportunities. After graduating with my degree, I hope to
                        work as a software developer.
                        Eventually, I would like to create my own
                        technology/software company.
