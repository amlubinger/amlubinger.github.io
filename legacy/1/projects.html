            <br><strong>My Projects:</strong><br>

            <br><em>Hyland Software Senior Project:</em>
            <br>Gained valuable experience and observed a successful software
            company while meeting with leaders and working on coding
            challenges. Completed a mini hackathon in which my partner and I
            were awarded first prize for the creation of multiple games (i.e.
            Checkers and Hangman) combined into one program - written in C#.<br>
            <br><em>Writing Analytics Program:</em>
            <br>Developed a program written in Java that analyzed writing style
            using of multiple inputs, each from a
            different person. Given a new input written by one of the previous
            people, the program would accurately determine which person wrote
            the new input text based on the analytics from before. Project was
            awarded first prize among others.<br>

            <br><em>Energy Switch App:</em>
            <br>Developed an iOS app written in Swift designed to help users
            decide whether to
            switch to solar power or wind power at their business or house.
            Based on the user's geographical location and property size, the
            program would determine obtainable wind turbine energy and solar
            panel energy. After deciding which would be more effective for the
            user, the program outputs the pros and cons of each including short
            term costs and long term savings. Project was awarded Intel
            Excellence in Computer Science award among others.<br>

            <br><em>Personalized iPhone App:</em>
            <br>Developed an iOS app for a close friend, written in
            Swift. Features included background music, local push notifications,
            date management and calculations, photo album, customized messages,
            and more.<br>

            <br><em>Engineering Game:</em>
            <br>Developed, in a group of four, a game in Matlab with 1000 lines
            of code. The dungeon adventure game
            involved using a player to fight through five different randomly
            generated levels. Multiple power ups for extra speed, fighting
            ability, lives, etc. were included. Many different difficulty
            options were made available influencing power up frequency, monster
            frequency, and monster AI difficulty. Monster AI difficulty varied
            between random, attacking the player when within range, constantly
            chasing the player, and in between (i.e. increased likelihood of
            attacking player when within range).<br>

            <br><em>Engineering AEV:</em>
            <br>Created an autonomous electric vehicle in a group of 4. The
            small vehicle,
            propelled by small spinning blades, rode on a track attached to the
            ceiling. It had to stop and wait at a gate, pick up cargo, and more.
            Development process included brainstorming, building, testing,
            adjusting, and programming.<br>

            <br><em>Software Class Projects:</em>
            <br>Completed many projects for class both as an individual and with
            a partner. Of
            these projects, written in java, my personal favorite was an
            individual project in which the program read a scrambled document
            with overlaps of words before putting it completely back together.
            This project was compared to DNA sequencing strategies and was
            tested on a scrambled Declaration of Independence and Gettysburg
            Address.
