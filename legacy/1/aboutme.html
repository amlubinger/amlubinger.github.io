            <br>I am a second year Computer Science and Engineering student at
            The Ohio State University. My program includes a specialization in
            software engineering.
            I am eager to continue learning and creating <a
                href="https://andrewlubinger.dev/legacy/1/projects.html">projects</a>.
            I am looking to gain valuable
            experience through a summer internship program. I am passionate
            about software development and technology as a whole.

            <br><br>I have been interested in technological advancements for as long as I can remember, but my interests really expanded when
            I took AP Computer Science in my sophomore year of high school. This class very quickly became my favorite and it was my first 
            experience in programming. After such a positive experience, I went on to take a couple more programming classes: Honors Software Engineering
            and Honors Robotics. I also became a member of the Robotics team with a role in programming our robot. I joined our Science Olympiad team with an event leader
            role in my favorite event: Game On, in which a pair had to create a game using Scratch (a new type of programming to me). I also joined our Science
            and Engineering Fair Club. Through this club, I created an <a href="https://andrewlubinger.dev/legacy/1/projects.html">iPhone App and a Java program</a> 
            on my own and won awards. More recently, I have completed coursework and projects at The Ohio State University. I have also created another 
            <a href="https://andrewlubinger.dev/legacy/1/projects.html">iPhone App</a> in my own personal time. All of these projects have 
            impacted my knowledge, interests, and experience. My passion for software development has grown constantly since taking AP Computer Science and 
            it is still continuing to grow with every project I complete.

            <br><br>I am extremely excited to continue learning at The Ohio State University, complete personal projects, and gain experience through an 
            internship. I am motivated to earn one of these available opportunities. After graduating with my degree, I hope to work as a software developer. 
            Eventually, I would like to create my own technology/software company.
