                        <p>I grew up in Beachwood, Ohio (a suburb of Cleveland). Currently, I am a fourth year Computer Science and Engineering student
                        at The Ohio State University, graduating in the Spring. My program includes a
                        specialization in
                        software engineering.
                        I am eager to continue learning and creating <a
                            href="projects.html">projects</a>.
                        I am currently working and learning as a Software Engineer Intern at 
                        <a href="https://www.mimsoftware.com/" style="color: rgb(93, 21, 66)">MIM Software</a>! 
                        This past summer, I worked as a Software Engineer Intern at 
                        <a href="https://www.jpmorganchase.com/" style="color: rgb(93, 21, 66)">JPMorgan Chase & Co</a>! I am
                        passionate
                        about software development and technology as a whole.

                        <br/><br/>I have been interested in technological advancements
                        for as long as I can remember, but my interests really
                        expanded when
                        I took AP Computer Science in my sophomore year of high
                        school. This class very quickly became my favorite and it
                        was my first
                        experience in programming. After such a positive experience,
                        I went on to take a couple more programming classes: Honors
                        Software Engineering
                        and Honors Robotics. I also became a member of the Robotics
                        team with a role in programming our robot. I joined our
                        Science Olympiad team with an event leader
                        role in my favorite event: Game On, in which a pair had to
                        create a game using Scratch (a new type of programming to
                        me). I also joined our Science
                        and Engineering Fair Club. Through this club, I created an
                        <a
                            href="projects/energyswitch.html">iPhone
                            App</a> and a <a href="projects/writinganalytics.html">Java program</a>
                        on my own and won awards. More recently, I have completed
                        coursework and projects at The Ohio State University. I have participated
                        in multiple Hack OHI/O hackathons and have worked on other 
                        <a href="projects.html">projects</a> in my free time. Along with my internship experiences, I even had the opportunity
                        to develop a mobile app for West Virginia University, called <a href="projects/wvuinvolved.html">WVU Involved</a>.
                        All of these experiences have
                        impacted my knowledge and interests. My passion
                        for software engineering has grown constantly since taking
                        AP Computer Science and
                        it is still continuing to grow with every project I
                        complete.

                        <br/><br/>My favorite part of programming is how it feels like solving different types of puzzles, all at the same time. 
                        From jigsaw to object search to crossword to brain teaser to cryptanalysis, I frequently notice elements of these puzzles in programming. 
                        I really enjoy working on these challenges.

                        <br/><br/>I am extremely excited to continue learning at The
                        Ohio State University, complete personal <a href="projects.html">projects</a>, and gain
                        professional experience. After graduating with my degree, I hope to
                        work as a software engineer. I am particularly interested in mobile application development.
                        Eventually, I would like to create my own
                        technology/software company.
